# qrisk_cprd_aurum
QRISK2 single index date and time-updating scores updated for CPRD Aurum, and QRISK3 single index date and time-updating versions complete for CPRD Aurum

• Within these files is a set of programs designed to calculate QRISK2 2015 and QRISK3 2017 scores in CPRD Aurum data using Stata.

• The programs collate data from a CPRD extract and identify all variables required for calculation of QRISK2 and QRISK3. They calculate QRISK2 and QRISK3 scores for all patients, irrespective of missingness.

• The main program file, which draws on the other folder contents, is pr_qrisk.do

• The bundle can calculate a one off score on the index date of your choice (single point QRISK), or can update each time one of its components is updated (time updating QRISK).

• The aim was to try and replicate QRISK2 scores recorded in the data as closely as possible rather than to use best practice definitions of each score component.

• See "QRISK bundle documentation_v2.1_10122021" for a complete explanation of files.
